Upgrading Instructions
======================

This following instructions contain the essential steps for upgrading your
FLOW3 1.0 based applications to FLOW3 1.1.

Full Changelog
--------------

If in doubt, you'll find many answers to possible questions still
unanswered after reading this document by browsing
through the `full changelogs <http://flow3.typo3.org/documentation/guide/partv/changelogs.html>`_.

Frozen packages
---------------

FLOW3 1.1 contains new mechanisms which improve the development and production
speed. An important feature is the ability to freeze packages.

For performance reasons, the file monitor won't track modifications to files
of frozen packages. After flushing the code caches with ``flow3:cache:flush``
FLOW3 will not reflect classes contained in frozen packages but instead
retrieve reflection data from a special cache file which is preserved even
during the cache flush.

If class files contained in frozen packages are modified, the whole application
may behave rather unexpectedly. Therefore you need to make sure that the packages
you are working on currently are not frozen.

There are few easy to use commands to control the frozen state of packages::

	./flow3 package:list

will list all available packages and indicates which ones are currently frozen.

::

	./flow3 package:freeze TYPO3.FLOW3

freezes the package ``TYPO3.FLOW3`` and

::

	./flow3 package:unfreeze TYPO3.FLOW3

unfreezes it again so that modifications are detected. If a package should stay
frozen but its reflection data should be updated once, you can simply run::

	./flow3 package:refreeze TYPO3.FLOW3

Instead of a package key you may also specify the magic keyword ``all`` or
leave the package key out completely. If your application behaves strangely,
possibly due to a prior fatal error, you can still use the new ``--force``
option which empties all existing caches and runs in a special "safe mode"::

	./flow3 flow3:cache:flush --force

Code migration
--------------

The majority of code changes you will need to do to your applications
can be done automatically with the new code migration tool provided with
FLOW3 1.1. If you have your packages under Git version control and the
working copies are clean a simple::

 ./flow3 core:migrate

will adjust your code as needed and commit the changes as a migration,
recording the applied migration in the commit message.

Feel free to amend the commit as needed, if further adjustments are needed.

.. hint::
 The migration tool will output a list of notes and warnings about things
 that you might need to adjust manually - make sure to read those.

Also, read the remainder of this document, it contains more details about the
changes and possible solutions to problems. The code changes automated with
the migration tool are explained in detail at the end of this document.

Package layout changes
----------------------

The ``Doctrine`` package that was part of the FLOW3 1.0 base distributions has
been split into three packages ``Doctrine.Common``, ``Doctrine.DBAL`` and
``Doctrine.ORM``. If you maintain your own Git submodule records, you should
remove the old ``Doctrine`` submodule and add the split Doctrine packages to
your super project instead.

Session configuration changes
-----------------------------

The configuration for the PhpSession is now read from a setting named
``PhpSession`` instead of the former ``PHPSession``. You should adjust your
settings accordingly.

Database schema changes
-----------------------

As always you should check the database migration status and apply new
migrations if there are any. Use::

 ./flow3 doctrine:migrationstatus

to check and::

 ./flow3 doctrine:migrate

to apply any pending migrations.

This will take care of the schema updates for packages that supply their
needed adjustments. For your own package you will most likely need to create
(and adjust) a migration to accommodate it to new behavior in FLOW3 1.1. To do
that use::

 ./flow3 doctrine:migrationgenerate

Here are the things that changed in FLOW3 that you should expect to see in
a schema migration:

* long table names get shortened
* nullable column defaults and
* unique keys for identity properties of entities.

(Overly) long table names (more than 63 chars in most cases) are now shortened.
Thus you should make sure that affected tables are renamed correctly in your
generated schema migrations.

NULL handling for columns has changed. FLOW3 1.1 now defaults to non-nullable
columns to behave like Doctrine. This means any column for a literal property
will be generated as a non-nullable column. For existing columns you will see
adjustments in the generated schema migration.

If you want your column to actually be able to contain NULL values, you must
annotate your property with::

 @ORM\Column(nullable=true)

Another change is caused by a new feature: the properties of an entity that are
marked with the ``Identity`` annotation are now transformed into an unique index in
the database. The needed index creation statements will also be part of the
generated schema migration.

Security framework
------------------

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The previously shipped *DefaultProvider* authentication provider
  configuration has been removed, you must configure all providers yourself now.

  .. note::

   The authentication provider name (previously: "DefaultProvider") must match the
   provider name which is stored with each account. Either configure your own
   authentication provider with the name "DefaultProvider" or configure a new one
   with a different name and update the accounts accordingly.
* ``providerClass`` is deprecated, use ``provider`` instead. Provider
  options are now given in ``providerOptions``.
* Authentication entrypoint configuration needs to be changed from::

   entryPoint:
     WebRedirect:
       uri: login.html

  to::

   entryPoint: 'WebRedirect'
   entryPointOptions:
     uri: 'login.html'

Password hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default hashing strategy for passwords was changed from PBKDF2 to BCrypt.
Also it is now possible to use a mix of password hashing strategies, as the
used strategy is stored in the ``credentialsSource`` property of an account.

One way to get existing accounts working again is to make sure your default
strategy setting matches the used strategy for any accounts created before
the change::

 TYPO3:
   FLOW3:
     security:
       cryptography:
         hashingStrategies:
           default: pbkdf2

Setting the default strategy to match the one used for 1.0.x will not take
advantage of the new (more secure) hashing. Therefore a new **fallback**
configuration option was added. It allows to specify the strategy that was
used to generate legacy credentials. It defaults to ``pbkdf2`` and allows for
a seamless migration from 1.0 to 1.1. New passwords will be hashed with
the default strategy (``bcrypt`` by default) and get the strategy identifier
prepended.

.. hint::
 For the strategy … your credentials look like …:

 pbkdf2
  7kP/laYDXxQ=,iMoNTRTcbY01Q9LSeAaoxV9hq … QEmHm3ottU1yJdw==
 bcrypt
  $2a$14$2zNPS6TfbMPCdnxuRlheu.2kZAJ … H3DaYwqqIeAgPzN6kTS
 saltedmd5
  2f1861241e1951f8696f80cf71b43dee,029fc4310e

YAML syntax
-----------

The YAML parser has been updated and now behaves stricter and more correct:

 * Boolean values must no longer be written as ``y``, ``yes``, ``n``, ``no`` but
   as ``TRUE`` and ``FALSE`` instead.
 * When using backslashes in strings, those are now handled as escape characters
   inside double quotes. So if you write class names, better wrap them in single
   quotes.

Routing
-------

Widget configuration in *Routes.yaml* has changed and needs to be adjusted. If
you used e.g. ``@widget_0.currentPage`` in *Routes.yaml* you need to change that to
use the correct widget identifier prefixed a double dash. By default the widget
identifier is the lowercased fully qualified widget classname with dashes instead
of backslashes. For the paginate viewhelper it would thus be
``typo3-fluid-viewhelpers-widget-paginateviewhelper``.

To make things easier and more telling, you can also set a custom widget id in
your template. On the widget tag simply set the "widgetId" attribute and use the
same in Routes.yaml. This way you can use e.g. "--paginate":

*Template.html*::

  <f:widget.paginate widgetId="paginate" …>

*Routes.yaml*::

  uriPattern:    'posts/page/{--paginate.currentPage}'
  defaults:
    '@controller': 'Post'
    '@action':     'index'
    '--paginate':
      '@controller':  ''
      '@package':     ''

Custom Request Handling
-----------------------

If you created custom RequestHandler/-Builder you most probably need to adjust those:

Custom RequestHandlers need to be registered in your
*Package.php*::

  public function boot(\TYPO3\FLOW3\Core\Bootstrap $bootstrap) {
  	$bootstrap->registerRequestHandler(new \Your\Package\Your\RequestHandler($bootstrap));
  }

In your RequestHandler you probably want to create an *HttpRequest* first::

  $this->request = \TYPO3\FLOW3\Http\Request::createFromEnvironment();

Then you can create an *ActionRequest* with::

  $this->request->createActionRequest();

Some more pitfalls:

* RequestBuilders are not required anymore, instead you create request & response
  in the RequestHandler
* If you want to use the routing framework, have a look at
  *\\TYPO3\\FLOW3\\Http\\RequestHandler::handleRequest()*
* Some convenience methods were removed from *\\TYPO3\\FLOW3\\Utility\\Environment*.
  You can use corresponding functions of the HttpRequest mostly

Fluid
-----

The ``form.textbox`` tag has been renamed to ``form.textfield``.

Manual code migration
=====================

In case you do not want or cannot use the automated code migration, this is what
needs to be adjusted:

* Replace

  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\CLI`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Cli``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\Routing`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Mvc\Routing``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\Request`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Mvc\ActionRequest``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\Response`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Http\Response``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\SubRequest`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Mvc\ActionRequest``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\SubResponse`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Http\Response``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Controller\CommandController`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Cli\CommandController``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Property\DataType\Uri`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Http\Uri``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\AOP`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Aop``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Mvc``
  * ``TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\RequestInterface`` with ``TYPO3\FLOW3\Http\Request``
  * ``\AOP`` with ``\Aop``
  * ``\MVC`` with ``\Mvc``

* Use ``getMainRequest()`` instead of ``getRootRequest()``
* Use ``getInternalArgument('__submittedArgumentValidationResults')`` instead of ``getOriginalRequestMappingResults()``
* Use ``getInternalArgument('__submittedArguments')`` instead of ``getOriginalRequest()->getArguments()``
* Use ``$this->controllerContext->getRequest()->getHttpRequest()->getBaseUri()`` instead of ``$this->controllerContext->getRequest()->getBaseUri()``
* ``\TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\RequestBuilder`` does not exist anymore. If you need to
  create requests, do ``new ActionRequest($parentRequest)``.
* ``\TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\Web\SubRequestBuilder`` does not exist anymore. If you need to
  create sub requests, do ``new ActionRequest($parentRequest)``.
* ``\TYPO3\FLOW3\MVC\RequestInterface`` has been removed, use
  ``\TYPO3\FLOW3\Http\Request`` instead - e.g. if you implemented your own token.
* ``$supportedRequestTypes`` are not needed anymore in a controller.

.. warning::
 Class names in pointcut expressions might not be fully qualified, check whether
 (more) adjustments are needed.
