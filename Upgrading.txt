UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

This file contains instructions for upgrading your FLOW3 1.0 alpha 14 installation to FLOW3 1.0 beta 1.

GIT SUBMODULES
--------------

The easy way, if you have no pending changes in submodules: pull or cherry-pick, then remove the old
framework package folders (everything in Framework *except* Doctrine and TYPO3).

The also easy way, if you have changes: pull or cherry-pick, and the move the old framework package
folders down into Packages/Framework/TYPO3. Check if you are based on what's current and rebase any
pending changes as needed.

VENDOR NAMESPACES
-----------------

FLOW3 now uses a different namespacing scheme which makes FLOW3 code more compatible with third-party libraries. You
will need to update all references to F3\* classes and use the new namespacing scheme. Packages provided by the FLOW3
core team now use the "TYPO3" vendor namespace. Your own packages must use a different vendor namespace, for example
your company website's domain name in reverse order: "Com\MyBusiness\MyPackageKey".

This version of FLOW3 comes with a migration script which migrates your PHP code. You may run the script from the
root directory of FLOW3 with the following command:

   php ./Packages/Framework/TYPO3/FLOW3/Scripts/migrate.php

The script replaces all occurences of F3\FLOW3 etc. by TYPO3\FLOW3, that includes references to all packages provided
by the FLOW3 base distribution (all those in "Framework"). All occurences of F3\... in _other_ packages (for example
your own packages in Application/) will be replaced by "YourCompanyName".

You'll need to take the following manual steps after automatic migration:

 - think of an own vendor namespace ("Com\MyBusiness") and globally replace "MyCompanyName" with "Com\MyBusiness"
 - move your own packages from the second level (usually below "Application") to a directory structure reflecting your
   new vendor namespace, for example "Application/Com/MyBusiness/MyPackageKey"
 - update all your .yaml files to the new structure (see below)
 - update all your Package.xml files to contain the new package key format (key and dependencies sections)
 - delete Configuration/PackageStates.php (will be regenerated automatically)
 - delete all directories below Data/Temporary/

SETTINGS / YAML-FILES
---------------------

The introduction of vendor namespaces also had an impact on the YAML files. Package keys in Settings.yaml must now
be converted into a correctly nested structure. Previously you had Settings.yaml files like these:

YourPackageKey:
  option1: "foo"

Now you will need a structure like this:

Com:
  YourCompanyName:
    YourPackageKey:
      option1: "foo"

Likewise all your settings files referring to FLOW3 settings must be updated too:

TYPO3:
  FLOW3:
    security:
      enable: y

RESOURCES
---------

You will also need to update references to package resources if you use the stream wrapper. When you referred to a
resource like this in your package:

   resource://YourPackageKey/Private/Templates/MainTemplate.html

You'll have to adjust it like to this:

   resource://Com.YourCompanyName.YourPackageKey/Private/Templates/MainTemplate.html

PACKAGE KEYS
------------

The format of package keys also had to be changed. The vendor namespace is now included in the package key and we're
using the dot "." as a delimiter. The package key "FLOW3" is now "TYPO3.FLOW3". Another valid new package key would be
"Com.YourCompanyName.YourPackageKey".

Make sure to search your code for uses of package keys. Maybe you have PHP code using a package key for rendering a
resource URI – that needs to be modified.
