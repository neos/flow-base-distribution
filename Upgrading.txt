UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

This file contains instructions for upgrading your FLOW3 1.0.4 installation
to FLOW3 1.0.5.

USING RELEASE ARCHIVES
----------------------

If you use release archives, unpacking the new archive on top of the existing
code should be sufficient. Make sure to clean the caches afterwards using
 ./flow3 flow3:cache:flush

USING GIT
---------

If you live on the bleeding edge, you probably are ahead of 1.0.5 by now.

How you best update the codebase depends on how you tied the FLOW3 code into
your local repository, so we cannot give advice that fits all.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you run into trouble, make sure to check the logs. If that doesn't help,
feel free to join us in IRC on freenode at #flow3 and ask for help.
